# Sous_v1:
Sous_v1 is a full we application made as a portfolio project using technologies such as
* Express.js
* mongoDB
* PUG
* Node.js

## Functionality:
* Sous allows a user to sign into a user generated account from data stored on a external mongoDB server
* The user is able to search for recipes using a search bar
* The user can then store the recipes they want to their account
* The user may access these recipes and delete them from the website

### Technologies:
* Express.js - I used express.js as my backend framework (I wanted to create a full javascript web application)
* (mongoDB + linux-server) - I hosted my own configured noSQL database on a external linux server which I then accessed using mongoose in my application.
* (PUG + CSS) - I then used PUG to create a simple front-end to show off my back-end functionalities.

#### API's / Other:
* For this project I used Spoonicular web API to find and store recipes.
* https://spoonacular.com/
* I hosted my project using heroku
* https://www.heroku.com/
